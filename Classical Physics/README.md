# Classical Physics Simulation
Classical Physics has many different rules that demonstrate the way in which particles should move within our universe. However, particles do not follow all of these rules. 

## Pitfalls
This branch of the Simulation Project is mostly for demonstrative purposes. 

### Electrons
In classical physics, it is understood that electrons orbit around the nucleus of the atom. However, we also have laws that demonstrate that energy is radiated by a point charge as it accelerates. Electrons are point charges, and because they are orbiting, they are accelerating towards the nucleus. Because they are accelerating, they should be releasing energy, implying that they are losing speed, so the electron should fall in its orbit until it reaches the nucleus. Since we observe electrons orbiting nuclei and classical physics tells us that we should not see that, classical physics must be incorrect in describing the motion of subatomic particles.
